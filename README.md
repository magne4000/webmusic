Webmusic
========
Webmusic is a HTML5 web application that can play music files.  
The app relies on a SQL database which can be generated by [webmusicscanner](https://github.com/magne4000/webmusicscanner), but 
now it can be done easely via admin interface.

Dependencies
------------
php5-curl

Installation
------------
Simply clone the project in your favorite webserver document root.  
e.g. (Apache)

    cd /var/www && git clone https://github.com/magne4000/webmusic

To init the database, there is a _webmusic.sql_ file that you can import after having created a new empty database called
webmusic, with a specific user which have read/write access to this database.

Configuration
-------------
In order to configure the app, you need to have a file called webmusic.conf in the app directory.  
A sample file called _webmusic.conf.default_ is available, so we base webmusic.conf on it

    cp app/webmusic.conf.default app/webmusic.conf

The **db** section allows you to set your BDD credentials and your timezone.  
The **scanner** section is the configuration about the database update process:
  * If the **root** parameter
    is set to _/home/user/music_ and **root_url** to _http://mydomain.com/music_, and if you have a music
    file _/home/user/music/Artist1/Album1/mymusic.mp3_, it must be accessible at _http://mydomain.com/music/Artist1/Album1/mymusic.mp3_.

The **debug** section allows you to switch ON/OFF debugging.  
The **cache** section can be tweaked if your database as a huge amount of artists.  
The **soundmanager** section must logically not be changed, but if you're having troubles playing your music, you can try to change those [soundmanager](http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/doc/) settings 
The **admin** section must be filled if you want to have access the player administration. 

### Cache
To init the cache files, the folder cache must be writable (or owned) by the web server.  
e.g. (Apache)

    chown www-data:www-data cache

Administration
--------------

In order to have access to admin page, you must have filled **user** parameter in **admin** section of the configuration file.
Then open your browser to http://YOURSERVER/path_to_webmusic/admin and log in.  
From there, you can update the database (it will regenerate the cache when it finish) or empty it. If the update script
has been stopped before its completion you just have to relaunch the update and the process will be resumed.

Plugins
-------
Each plugin must be stored into a folder under the **plugins** directory.  
If this folder contains a **js** directory, all .js files beneath it will be automatically loaded just before init.js.  
If it contains a **css** folder, all .css files beneath it will be loaded after all other non-plugin css files.

### Client side plugin

All plugins are handled by jQuery events, for an example, see the **notifications** plugin. In order to see all events in detail, refer to [wiki](https://github.com/magne4000/webmusic/wiki).

### Server side plugin

If the plugin folder contains an __init.php__ file, it will be loaded on the server side.
